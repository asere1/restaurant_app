For storing user data, a local database is implemented, so user data will not be lost, even if there is no internet connection.

A beautiful splash screen, will be the first thing that users see when the app is launched, providing an attractive introduction to the app and giving users a smooth transition into the app's main features and functionality.

Overall, this app is a great example of a professional, well-designed, and efficient mobile application built using Flutter, Postman API, and Getx state management
